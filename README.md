A simple breakout board for an OPS (Open Pluggable Specification) board

Why am I making this?:

I wanted a breakout board for my OPS, I couldn't find any online so I decided to try and make my own

Simplified backstory of thr OPS:

The Open Pluggable Specification is an open standard created by Intel, Microsoft and NEC and the late 2000's. The open standard specifies the form factor and specific connector used by digitale signate PC's.
It was created to make supporting and operation digital signage easier, specifically upgrading and replacement of the PC.

My goals with this project:
 Project goals:
  * I want to create a working prototype 
  * I want a breakout board that has USB-C PD (12v/15v) 

 Personal goals:
  * I want to learn how to use KiCAD

 Future goals:
  * Multiple node PCB
  
The specific model I have is the i5C811N from cTouch (https://docs.i3-connect.com/__attachments/a_c15a1eb9fd8637d504866d565766ad248647e5b8e99365b778d86a857d29d207/OPS%20PC%20module%20i5%20tech%20dataV200611%20EN.pdf?cb=845e61cd99db52ae6301f15f583c4827)
